        "ANS. Random sampling plays a crucial role in making inferences about populations. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Representativeness: Random sampling ensures that the sample is representative of the population. This means that the sample will have similar characteristics, patterns, and trends as the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Reducing bias: Random sampling helps to reduce bias in the selection of participants. By using random methods, researchers can avoid selecting participants based on personal preferences, preconceptions, or convenience.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Increasing generalizability: Random sampling allows researchers to make inferences about the population with greater confidence. By using a random sample, researchers can generalize their findings to the larger population.\n",

        "4. Enabling statistical analysis: Random sampling enables researchers to use statistical methods to analyze their data. Statistical tests assume that the data are randomly sampled from the population.\n",

        "To achieve these benefits, researchers use various random sampling techniques, such as:\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS. Skewness refers to the asymmetry of a distribution, which means that one side of the distribution is longer or more extreme than the other. There are three types of skewness:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Positive Skewness: The distribution is skewed to the right, with a longer tail on the right side. This means that there are more extreme values on the higher end of the scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Negative Skewness: The distribution is skewed to the left, with a longer tail on the left side. This means that there are more extreme values on the lower end of the scale.\n",

        "- Mean vs. Median: In a skewed distribution, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew, while the median remains more central. This means that the mean may not accurately represent the typical value.\n",

        "3. Identify outliers: Data points that fall outside these bounds are considered outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if the IQR is 10, Q1 is 20, and Q3 is 30, the lower and upper bounds would be:\n",
